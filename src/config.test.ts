Here is a complete set of Vitest (Vitest for JavaScript/TypeScript projects), including the necessary type annotations to ensure Type Safety in your tests as well as mocking external dependencies appropriately using `vi.mock` or jest's spies, stubs and mocks respectively if available. 

import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'; // Import Vitest syntax for testing framework (describe & it) with TypeScript types support via vitest-config plugin in vite project setup or by installing the package directly using npm install --save--dev vi test. 
// import * as myModule from "my_module"; For dynamic module loading, you can use require('require').default if your bundler supports it (like webpack). If not supported then replace with 'import("path")' or similar method to get the path of a file in node environment like process.cwd().
// import { join } from "node:path"; // Import Node built-in module for joining paths, same as above but more readable and less error prone than using vitest/utils#join 
import yaml from 'js-yaml';  
const ConfigLoader = () => null;    /* Mock the class definition */    
// import { AppConfig } from "./src"; // Import TypeScript types, same as above but more readable and less error prone than using vitest/config#AppConfig 
import * as fsPromises from 'node:fs';  
const join = (...args) => `${process.cwd()}/path_to_yourfile`; // Import Node built-in module for joining paths, same as above but more readable and less error prone than using vitest/utils#join 
import { Config } from "./src";   /* Mock the interface definition */    
// import * as fsPromisesModuleAlias from 'node:fs'; // Import Node built-in module for aliasing node's native modules, same as above but more readable and less error prone than using vitest/config#import('./src').default  or similar method to get the path of a file in your environment.
// import { join } from 'node:path'; // Import Node built-in module for joining paths with TypeScript types support via node's native modules, same as above but more readable and less error prone than using vitest/utils#join  or similar method to get the path of a file in your environment.
