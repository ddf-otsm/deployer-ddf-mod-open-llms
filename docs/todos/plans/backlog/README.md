# Backlog Tasks Index

This directory contains individual task files broken down from the consolidated backlog. Each task is actionable and can be assigned independently.

## Priority 1: Core Infrastructure

| ID | Task | Status | File |
|----|------|--------|------|
| P1-1 | Complete Fresh Clone Testing | Not Started | [P1-1-fresh-clone-testing.md](tasks/P1-1-fresh-clone-testing.md) |
| P1-2 | Fix Missing Template Files | Not Started | [P1-2-fix-missing-templates.md](tasks/P1-2-fix-missing-templates.md) |
| P1-3 | Update Setup Scripts | Not Started | [P1-3-update-setup-scripts.md](tasks/P1-3-update-setup-scripts.md) |

## Priority 2: Development Workflow

| ID | Task | Status | File |
|----|------|--------|------|
| P2-1 | Implement Git Hooks | Not Started | [P2-1-implement-git-hooks.md](tasks/P2-1-implement-git-hooks.md) |
| P2-2 | Documentation Updates | Not Started | [P2-2-documentation-updates.md](tasks/P2-2-documentation-updates.md) |

## Priority 3: Production Readiness

| ID | Task | Status | File |
|----|------|--------|------|
| P3-1 | AWS Integration | Not Started | _To be created_ |
| P3-2 | Docker Optimization | Not Started | _To be created_ |
| P3-3 | CI/CD Pipeline | Not Started | _To be created_ |

## Task File Format

Each task file follows this structure:
- **Header**: Priority, status, assignee, due date
- **Description**: What needs to be done
- **Tasks**: Specific actionable items
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Definition of done
- **Dependencies**: Other tasks that must be completed first
- **Notes**: Additional context

## Usage

1. **Pick a task**: Choose from Priority 1 first
2. **Check dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite tasks are complete
3. **Update status**: Mark as "In Progress" when starting
4. **Track progress**: Check off completed items
5. **Mark complete**: Update status to "Done" when finished

## Rules

- Priority 1 tasks must be completed before Priority 2
- Tasks with dependencies cannot start until dependencies are complete
- Each task should be small enough to complete in 1-2 days
- Update task files as work progresses
