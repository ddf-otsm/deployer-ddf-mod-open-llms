# Repository Consolidation & Deprecation Plan

*Created: 2025-05-27* | *Updated: 2025-05-27* | *Completion: 100% (Local Migration)*

## Problem Statement

We have two local directories and two remote repositories that need consolidation:

### Current Situation
- **WRONG DIR**: `deployer-ddf-mod-llm-models` (local only, no git) - ✅ Files migrated, backup created
- **RIGHT DIR**: `deployer-ddf-mod-open-llms` (correct, has git remote) - ✅ Active and working
- **WRONG REMOTE**: `deployer-ddf-open-llms` (to be deprecated) - ⏳ Pending deprecation
- **RIGHT REMOTE**: `deployer-ddf-mod-open-llms` (correct) - ✅ Active and working

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: File Analysis & Migration ✅
1. **Identify Missing Files**: Compare both directories - ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Migrate Important Files**: Copy missing files to correct directory - ✅ COMPLETED
3. **Update Documentation**: Document all moves in logs/move.log - ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 2: Local Directory Cleanup 🚧
1. **Backup Wrong Directory**: Create archive before deletion - ✅ COMPLETED
   - Backup created at: `~/Desktop/deployer-ddf-mod-llm-models-backup-20250527.tar.gz`
2. **Verify Migration**: Ensure all important files are in correct location - ✅ COMPLETED
   - All critical files verified present
   - Application running correctly on port 5001
3. **Delete Wrong Directory**: Remove `deployer-ddf-mod-llm-models` - ✅ COMPLETED
   - Script created: `scripts/cleanup-wrong-directory.sh`
   - Executed successfully on 2025-05-27 12:56:47
   - Cleanup report: `logs/cleanup-report-20250527_125647.md`

### Phase 3: Remote Repository Deprecation 🚧
1. **Update Wrong Remote README**: Mark as DEPRECATED - ✅ MATERIALS PREPARED
   - Template created: `docs/todos/plans/in-progress/deprecated-readme-template.md`
   - Manual checklist: `logs/manual-deprecation-checklist-20250527_130511.md`
2. **Rename Wrong Remote**: Change to `deprec-deployer-ddf` - ⏳ PENDING MANUAL EXECUTION
3. **Archive Wrong Remote**: Make it read-only - ⏳ PENDING MANUAL EXECUTION
   - Instructions created: `docs/todos/plans/in-progress/github-deprecation-steps.md`
   - GitHub CLI commands: `logs/github-cli-commands-20250527_130511.sh`

## Automated Execution Plan

### Immediate Actions (Ready to Execute)

1. **Execute Local Cleanup** (Estimated: 2 minutes):
   ```bash
   # Verify backup exists
   ls -la ~/Desktop/deployer-ddf-mod-llm-models-backup-20250527.tar.gz
   
   # Execute cleanup with verification
   ./scripts/cleanup-wrong-directory.sh --verify-backup
   
   # Confirm deletion
   ls -la ../deployer-ddf-mod-llm-models 2>/dev/null || echo "✅ Directory successfully removed"
   ```

2. **Prepare Remote Deprecation** (Estimated: 5 minutes):
   ```bash
   # Generate deprecation assets
   ./scripts/deprecate-remote-repository.sh --prepare-only
   
   # Review generated files
   cat /tmp/github-deprecation-checklist.md
   ```

3. **Execute Remote Deprecation** (Manual GitHub steps):
   - Follow: `docs/todos/plans/in-progress/github-deprecation-steps.md`
   - Use automation helper: `scripts/github-deprecation-helper.sh`

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Local verification
./scripts/verify-migration-complete.sh

# Remote verification  
./scripts/verify-remote-deprecation.sh

# Full system test
./run.sh --env=dev --platform=cursor --fast --verify-migration
```

# Execute with full verification
./scripts/cleanup-wrong-directory.sh --verify-backup --test-after
```

### Priority 2: Remote Repository Deprecation (Today)
```bash
# Prepare deprecation materials
./scripts/deprecate-remote-repository.sh --prepare-only

# Execute manual GitHub steps (requires admin access)
# Follow: docs/todos/plans/in-progress/github-deprecation-steps.md

# Verify completion
./scripts/verify-remote-deprecation.sh
```

### Priority 3: Documentation and Communication (Tomorrow)
```bash
# Update all documentation
./scripts/update-migration-docs.sh

# Generate migration completion report
./scripts/generate-migration-report.sh
```

## Enhanced Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (if issues detected)
```bash
# Restore from backup
./scripts/rollback-migration.sh --restore-from-backup

# Verify restoration
./scripts/verify-rollback-complete.sh
```

### Selective Rollback Options
1. **Restore specific files only**: `./scripts/rollback-migration.sh --selective`
2. **Restore and re-migrate**: `./scripts/rollback-migration.sh --restore-and-retry`
3. **Emergency stop**: `./scripts/rollback-migration.sh --emergency-stop`

## Success Criteria (Enhanced)

### Technical Success
