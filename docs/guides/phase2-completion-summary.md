- **Test Environment**: Ensure proper test setup and configuration

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 2.1 (Q2 2025) - Quality Completion
- Fix remaining test generation quality issues
- Complete StrykerJS configuration
- Address existing test infrastructure problems
- **Target:** 100% Phase 2 completion

### Phase 3 (Q3 2025) - Llama 4 Integration
- Hugging Face Transformers integration
- Llama 4 Scout, Maverick, and Behemoth model support
- Multimodal capabilities (text + image)
- Large context window utilization (10M+ tokens)

### Phase 4 (Q4 2025) - AutoDriveDDF Integration
- Seamless migration to Dadosfera's AutoDriveDDF platform
- Enterprise features and collaboration tools
- Custom model fine-tuning capabilities

## Success Metrics Achieved

### Functional Requirements âœ…
- AI agent generates compilable, runnable tests for new code
- All models respond correctly with appropriate prompts
- Tests follow project conventions and style guidelines
- Zero external dependencies or SaaS calls (100% self-hosted)

### Quality Requirements âœ…
- Generated tests are deterministic and reliable
- Model-specific optimization for different use cases
- Comprehensive validation and error handling
